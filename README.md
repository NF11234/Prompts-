# Prompts-
In the context of natural language processing (NLP), a prompt is a starting point or a cue that you provide to a language model to generate a response. Think of it as a question or a statement that prompts the language model to generate a relevant response.

## For example, let's say you want to use a language model to generate a description of a dog. You might provide a prompt such as "Describe a dog's appearance." The language model would then generate a response based on the prompt, such as "Dogs typically have fur that can be short or long, with a variety of colors and patterns. They also have four legs, a tail, and pointed ears."
Prompts can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks, including language translation, question-answering, summarization, and more. They allow you to customize the output of the language model and provide it with context to generate more accurate and relevant responses.
